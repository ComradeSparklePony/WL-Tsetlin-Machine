(items with an asterisk before them are completed)
*1. Read through resources
2. Implement a simple Tsetlin Automaton (naive, simple implementation, don't focus on optimizing)
3. Learn something simple with a Tsetlin Automaton. Do not worry about creating learning framework, just figure out how to apply individually.
3. Implement a Basic Tsetlin Machine (Basic Tsetlin Machine architecture p8)
4. Learn something with a basic Tsetlin machine. Do not worry about creating the framework.
5. Create a framework for Basic Tsetlin machines.
6. Expand basic tsetlin machine implementation to expanded Tsetlin machine architecture (p10) and update framework.
7. Change Tsetlin Automaton to be more optimized.
8. Implement more advanced Tsetlin-machine based architectures (Multi-class, deep, convolutional, continuous, regressional)
